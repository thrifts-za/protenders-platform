Their goal has always been to help fellow bloggers around the world with high-quality WordPress products.

In their blogging careers, they used hundreds of different products, many of which were top notch. But the one thing that they never found a perfect solution for was SEO.

There are many SEO plugins for WordPress that have a lot of features and are well made, but all of those plugins have some or the other missing feature that gives a feeling of incompleteness, like eating food without proper seasoning.

Around three years ago, they decided to fix the problem once and for all. They set out to create the ultimate SEO plugin for WordPress that would dwarf any other SEO plugin in features, usability, and speed. Rank Math was born.

Over three years, they have forged and perfected Rank Math to be the ultimate SEO plugin. Rank Math is more advanced, has more features, and is more powerful than any other SEO plugin.

Rank Math solves SEO problems that you didn’t even know you had. For example, Rank Math has an in-built keyword rank tracker which tracks your post’s position in the SERPs. Not only that, but Rank Math also emails you when your posts first start appearing in the search results. This gives you an unprecedented advantage to optimize your posts around new keywords.

Rank Math does all that while saving you hundreds, if not thousands of dollars that you would have invested in a professional rank tracker.

Migrating from other SEO plugins to Rank Math is also very easy. Rank Math can copy all the necessary settings from your existing plugin in a single click. You can start benefiting from Rank Math’s power in just a few minutes after installation.
