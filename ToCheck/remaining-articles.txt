[**Start your sefa application →**](/funding/match)

## Common Reasons for sefa Application Rejection

### Reason #1: Insufficient Cash Flow (35% of rejections)

**The problem:** Business income cannot comfortably cover loan repayments.

**How sefa assesses:**
- Monthly net income must exceed monthly loan repayment by 20%
- Debt service coverage ratio minimum 1.2x

**Example:**
- Loan repayment: R10,000/month
- Required net income: R12,000/month minimum (R10K + 20%)
- If your average monthly profit is R11,000 → **Rejected**

**Fix before applying:**
- Reduce loan amount to match cash flow capacity
- Extend repayment term to lower monthly installment
- Increase revenue before applying
- Reduce other debts first

### Reason #2: Poor Credit History (25%)

**The problem:** Defaults, judgments, or high debt elsewhere.

**What triggers rejection:**
- Judgments in last 24 months
- Current accounts in arrears
- Multiple declined credit applications recently
- Debt-to-income ratio above 60%

**Fix before applying:**
- Settle outstanding judgments
- Bring all accounts current (3+ months good payment history)
- Negotiate payment plans with creditors
- Wait 6-12 months after negative items cleared

### Reason #3: Weak Business Plan (20%)

**The problem:** Unrealistic projections, no market validation, vague strategy.

**Red flags for sefa:**
- Revenue projections exceeding industry norms (>50% annual growth without basis)
- No competitor analysis
- No evidence of customers or contracts
- Vague marketing strategy ("word of mouth")
- No consideration of risks

**Fix before applying:**
- Research industry benchmarks (turnover per employee, profit margins)
- Get customer letters of intent or contracts
- Conduct formal competitor analysis (mystery shopping, online research)
- Create realistic month-by-month projections with assumptions
- Address potential risks with mitigation strategies

### Reason #4: Inadequate Trading History (15%)

**The problem:** Business too new to assess viability.

**Minimum requirements:**
- R50K-R250K: 12 months trading
- R250K-R1M: 24 months trading
- R1M-R5M: 36 months trading

**If you don't meet it:**
- Apply for lower amount tier (if 12 months trading, max R250K)
- Wait until reaching minimum threshold
- Consider alternatives: NYDA (0-24 months trading), Isivande Women's Fund
- Build track record with smaller funding first

### Reason #5: Lack of Own Contribution (5%)

**The problem:** Requesting 100% funding with no equity stake.

**sefa expectations:**
- Micro loans (<R250K): 5-10% own contribution
- Small loans (R250K-R1M): 10-15%
- SME loans (R1M+): 15-25%

**Own contribution can be:**
- Cash savings in business account
- Value of existing business assets
- Personal assets contributed to business
- Sweat equity (documented hours at market rates)

## Maximizing Your sefa Approval Chances

### Tip #1: Demonstrate Strong Business Fundamentals

**What sefa loves to see:**
- Consistent month-on-month revenue (even if modest)
- Growing customer base (10+ active customers)
- Written contracts or purchase orders
- Repeat business (40%+ of revenue from repeat customers)
- Clear systems and processes (even if simple)

**How to show it:**
- Provide customer list with contact details (sefa may verify)
- Include testimonials or reference letters
- Show contracts/POs for next 3-6 months
- Document systems (SOP, checklists, workflows)

### Tip #2: Perfect Your Financial Projections

**Formula for credible projections:**

**Sales projection:**
- Base: Current average monthly sales (last 6 months)
- Growth: 5-10% monthly is realistic for first year with funding
- Seasonality: Factor in slow months (don't show linear growth)
- New contracts: Add confirmed contracts separately with dates

**Expenses projection:**
- Use actual historical expense percentages
- Cost of sales: Typically 40-60% of revenue
- Operating expenses: Should not exceed 30-35% of revenue
- New costs: Detail any additional costs from expansion

**Profitability:**
- Net profit margin 10-15% is realistic for most SMMEs
- Negative profit first 1-2 months while investing = OK
- Profitable by month 3-4 shows realism

### Tip #3: Secure Strong Business References

sefa contacts references for amounts above R250K:

**Customer references (2-3 required):**
- Companies you've supplied to
- Must confirm: contract size, payment history, satisfaction

**Supplier references (1-2 required):**
- Major suppliers to your business
- Must confirm: payment history, volumes, relationship length

**Professional references (1 required):**
- Accountant, lawyer, or industry mentor
- Must confirm: business knowledge, management capability

**Pro tip:** Brief your references before sefa contacts them. They should be prepared to give positive, specific feedback.

### Tip #4: Maintain Clean Business Finances

**30 days before applying:**
- Ensure no overdrafts or debit orders bouncing
- Keep minimum balance above R5,000 daily
- Avoid large cash deposits (looks suspicious)
- Ensure all transactions have clear descriptions

**Red flags that kill applications:**
- Multiple "Cash deposit" entries
- Frequent gambling transactions
- Payments to loan sharks
- NSF (non-sufficient funds) returns
- Unexplained large transfers in/out

## Grant Application Strategy: Maximizing Your Success

### Strategy 1: Apply to Multiple Grants Simultaneously

**Why:** Grant approval rates are 10-30%, so diversification increases chances.

**How to layer grants:**

**Example: Black-owned woman (28) starting catering business**

**Month 1:** Apply for NYDA grant (R100K)
**Month 2:** Apply for BBSDP (R1M with 20% contribution)
**Month 3:** Apply for GEP provincial grant (R200K)

**Potential outcome:**
- NYDA approved: R100K ✅
- BBSDP approved: R800K grant + R200K own ✅
- GEP declined: ❌

**Total grants secured:** R900K non-repayable funding

**Key rule:** Always disclose other pending applications. Funders coordinate and this transparency builds trust.

### Strategy 2: Use Grants Strategically as Own Contribution

**Smart layering:**

1. Secure small grant first (NYDA R100K)
2. Use grant proceeds as "own contribution" for larger cost-sharing grant
3. Access much larger total funding

**Example:**
- NYDA grant: R100K (secure first)
- Use as 20% own contribution for R500K BBSDP project
- BBSDP gives R400K grant
- **Total: R500K funding (R500K in grants, R0 out of pocket)**

### Strategy 3: Perfect Your Grant Application Package

**Grant applications are judged on:**

**1. Problem/Opportunity Clarity (25% of score)**
- What specific problem does your business solve?
- Why is this problem significant?
- Who experiences this problem?

**2. Solution Viability (25%)**
- How does your business solve it?
- Why is your solution better than alternatives?
- Evidence it works (pilot, testimonials, early sales)

**3. Impact Potential (25%)**
- How many jobs created?
- Community benefit?
- Economic impact?
- Transformation (race, gender, location)?

**4. Implementation Plan (15%)**
- Clear milestones
- Realistic timeline
- Resource allocation
- Risk mitigation

**5. Team Capability (10%)**
- Relevant experience
- Skills match to business needs
- Commitment (full-time vs part-time)

### Strategy 4: Attend Grant Provider Workshops

**Why it matters:**

- Direct feedback on your concept
- Networking with other applicants
- Build relationship with grant officers

**Where to find them:**
- NYDA hosts monthly entrepreneurship workshops (free)
- dtic regional offices run BBSDP clinics
- SEDA offers free grant application support nationwide
- Corporate ESD programs have information sessions

**Pro tip:** Bring draft business plan to workshop for review.

## Common Grant Application Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Asking for Wrong Amount

**Too little:** Request R80K when you actually need R200K
- Result: Project underfunded, can't complete objectives, grant wasted

**Too high:** Request R1M when R400K sufficient
- Result: Rejected as unrealistic or greedy

**Fix:** Create detailed budget with all costs itemized. Add 10-15% contingency.

### Mistake #2: Vague Use of Funds

**Bad:** "R100,000 for equipment and working capital"

**Good:**
- R45,000: Commercial oven (Brand X Model Y) - Quote attached
- R25,000: Display refrigerator - Quote attached
- R15,000: Kitchen utensils and cookware - Itemized list attached
- R10,000: Initial ingredients inventory - Detailed list attached
- R5,000: Packaging materials (2 months) - Quote attached

**Rule:** Every rand must be justified with specific purpose and supporting quote.

### Mistake #3: Copy-Paste Generic Applications

**Why it fails:** Grant evaluators read hundreds of applications. Generic, formulaic applications stand out negatively.

**Fix:** Customize each application:
- Reference specific grant criteria in your narrative
- Use language from grant guidelines
- Address program's specific focus (e.g., if grant prioritizes women, emphasize how your business empowers women)

### Mistake #4: Ignoring Reporting Requirements

**Reality:** Grants come with compliance obligations:
- Monthly/quarterly reports on fund usage
- Photos and receipts for all purchases
- Job creation verification
- Site visits and audits

**Mistake:** Viewing grant as "free money with no strings"

**Fix:** Understand obligations upfront. Factor time for reporting into your planning.

## Grant Approval Timeline & What to Expect

### Typical Grant Journey

**Week 1-2:** Application preparation
**Week 3:** Submission
**Week 4-6:** Initial screening and eligibility check
**Week 7-10:** Detailed evaluation (may include site visit)
**Week 11-12:** Decision by grant committee
**Week 13-15:** Contracting and disbursement setup
**Week 16:** Funds received

**Total:** 3-4 months for most programs

**Fast-track programs:**
- NYDA (can be 8-10 weeks)
- Provincial grants (some process in 6 weeks)

**Slow programs:**
- TIA (16-24 weeks due to technical evaluation)
- Corporate ESD (12-20 weeks)

### Managing Expectations

**Realistic approval scenarios:**

**If you apply to 5 grant programs:**
- 1-2 approvals: Expected outcome
- 3 approvals: Excellent outcome
- 0 approvals: Review and strengthen applications

**Don't put all your eggs in one basket.** Always have a Plan B (loans, own savings, bootstrapping).
